At five o’clock on a September afternoon Ronald Torbay was making preparations for his
third murder. He was being very careful. He realized that murdering people becomes more
dangerous if you do it often.
He was in the bathroom of the house that he had recently rented. For a moment he paused to
look in the mirror. The face that looked back at him was thin, middle-aged and pale. Dark
hair, a high forehead and well-shaped blue eyes. Only the mouth was unusual – narrow and
quite straight. Even Ronald Torbay did not like his own mouth.
A sound in the kitchen below worried him. Was Edyth coming up to have her bath before he
had prepared it for her? No, it was all right: she was going out of the back door. From the
window he saw her disappearing round the side of the house into the small square garden. It
was exactly like all the other gardens in the long street. He didn’t like her to be alone there.
She was a shy person, but now new people had moved into the house next door, and there was
a danger of some silly woman making friends with her. He didn’t want that just now.
